# Fire Insurance Demo

This repository holds the smart contracts, helper scripts and documentation for a fire insurance product.

The fire insurance product is a simple example product that can be used to demonstrate the basic functionality of the GIF platform. 
It is a simple parametric insurance product that pays out an amount of USDC if a fire event is triggered by the oracle depending on the fire category (_S_ - no payout, _M_ - 20% of the sum insured, _L_ - 100% of the sum insured).

Setup and usage instructions for the sandbox can be found on the [Sandbox documenation page](https://docs.etherisc.com/sandbox/).
