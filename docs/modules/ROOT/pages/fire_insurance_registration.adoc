= Fire insurance registration  

== Overview

In order to work with _GIF instance_ each component of _fire insurance_ undergoes registration. 
Registration procedure consists of component proposal tx (by component _owner_) followed by component approval tx (by _GIF instance operator_) with consequent configurations.

Each component has _owner_ (implements `getOwner()` method) and _type_ (implements `getType()` method).
Prior to registration, _GIF instance operator_ grants component _owner_ a role correspondent to component _type_. 

Components registration order is important: starting with `FireOracle`, followed by `FireRiskpool` and finishing with `FireProduct`.
